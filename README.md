# Pomodoro-Extension
I created a simple pomodorro extension for people to manage their time.

In this porject I learnt that in order to see the bigger picture I need to break the problems down into smaller pieces.

I used setInterval function because it was simple to use and I could specify the time interval of when the function should be retured.
I was able to create the clock function of the pomodorro technique.

after the 25 minute interval there is a break that lasts 5 minutes 

The extension also tracks the amount of pomodoros.
when the number of pomodoros reaches 4 the break time is extended to 15 minutes.

I had to make use of Chrome extension API functions for the extension to work in the backgorund will doing other browser work

In order to use this extension you have to clone the repo to your local machine, then head over to manage chrome extensions click developer mode and then click load unpacked.
Finally click on the extension icon on the top right of your browser and it should be there.

IMPOVEMENTS
The extension is lacking in colour and design.
I could add a settings tab so that people can customize to their liking.
I need to add sound or some nofications that notify the user when the timer starts and stops.
